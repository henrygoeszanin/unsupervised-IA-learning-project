# Simple Machine Learning Project

This project implements an unsupervised learning approach using a dataset with various features. The main objective is to analyze the data, apply clustering algorithms, and interpret the results.

```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Selection**: Run `data_selection.py` to load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Model Application**: Execute `model_application.py` to apply the clustering algorithm on the selected data.
3. **Result Analysis**: Use `result_analysis.py` to visualize and interpret the clustering results.
